### Working with remotes ###

NOTE:
# cloned repos have origin by default
git clone [url]
git fetch origin

# Showing remotes
.show configured remote servers (cd to path first)
git remote

.shows URLs Git has stored for the shortname to be used when read/write
git remote -v

# Adding Remote repos
.add remote explicitly
git remote add <shortname> <url>

NOTE:
# fetch command only downloads the data to local repo - it doesn't
# automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you're
# currently working on

.fetch all information from repo (updates repo)
git fetch <shortname>

# Fetch and pulling from Remotes
.get data from remote projects (updates repo: same as above)
git fetch [remote-name]

NOTE:
# if your current  branch is setup to track a remote branch
# use 'git pull' to automatically fetch and then merge the remote
# branch into your current branch

NOTE:
# 'git clone' automatically sets up your local master branch to
# track the remote master branch on the server you cloned from

.fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically
.tries to merge it into the code you're currently workin on
git pull

#Pushing to your Remotes
.push your project 'upstream'
git push [remote-name] [branch-name]

# Inspecting a remote
.see more information about a particular remote
git remote show [remote-name]
git remote show origin

# Removing and Renaming Remotes
.change a remote's shortname
git remote rename <OLDshortname> <NEWshortname>

NOTE:
# 'git remote rename' also changes all your remote-tracking
# branch names too

.remove remote
git remote rm <shortname>
